# Compiler-example
Solution for a hard exercise from WUT, where students had to develop own compiler for custom architecture

## ARCH
Architecture is described in specyfikacja.pdf file. As we can see this was a exercise for students in 2020.
The architecture is similar to x86 and programming language is like a subset of C/ADA/Pascal.
This project is a perfect example how to start with developing compilers.

### Virtual Machine
The professor from WUT created for student vm to simulate custom arch and also to calculate cycles. Feel free to optimize my compiler (there are a lot of possibilities), because this project is a only example, all of the optimization were skiped for simplicity.

### Tests
To test compiler I used E2E tests. Some of tests were created by myself and some are collected from professor examples for students

#### Contact
Feel free to asked any question about compiler. BUT I'm not going to help you with new compiler for your studies!!!
